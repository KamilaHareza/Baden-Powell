                <p>Baden-Powell was regarded as an excellent storyteller. 
                    During his whole life he told "ripping yarns" to audiences. 
                    After having published Scouting for Boys, Baden-Powell kept on writing more handbooks and educative materials for all Scouts, as well as directives for Scout Leaders. 
                    In his later years, he also wrote about the Scout movement and his ideas for its future. 
                    He spent most of the last two years of his life in Africa, and many of his later books had African themes.</p>
